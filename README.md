This module extends the Binary field/widget with inline PDF viewing support.

Current version is only a PoC and presently is able to achieve the above objective.

## Planned Updates
Needs smoothing off some quirks and organizing the code better to support additional features and customizations. Some initial planned areas to focus efforts on.

- Introduce a 'Render PDF' action to the existing actions (Edit, Download, Delete) to show document inline when PDF is uploaded and saved
- Exempt document rendering to ONLY PDFs. (Yet to check this out)
- Improve the looks of the grey header of the PDF viewer with something more vibrant, maybe also substitute the Prev/Next navigations with some arrow icons
